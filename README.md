# pythonCsvToJson

This is just something i need at work, you will not probably need this. However, this converts csv to json nicely, even if values have commas.

in root, app.py is a python code that converts csv to json.
so run that first. (python3 app.py)

then in finishProduct, there is a node code that converts bit street addresses, then merges all with same card_id and ads datas together.
Then converts back to csv.
